# letsencrypt-powershell
This is an initiative to port the letsencrypt functionality to Windows via PowerShell

You can read more about it here https://letsencrypt.org/

This is very early development. Assume nothing works. Please read the notes at 
the top of each script. If you wish to run any of these scripts please do so in
a non-production environment.

Thanks!
